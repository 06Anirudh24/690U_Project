# 690U_Project
This repository consists of the code for COMPSCI 690U final project - Beyond logistic regression: Evaluating ML algorithms for enzyme commission classification task. 
Link to dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/tattabio/ec_classification_dna
In this project, I attempted to classify nucleic acid sequences using: -
1. Two types of embedding techniques - one-hot encoding, k-mer encoding
2. Two ML algorithms - random forest, XGBoost
